    <h2>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer with experience in developing high-performance solutions for large-scale platforms.
      I have been involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle, including architecture, development,
      testing, deployment, monitoring, and production support.

      I have worked on developing resilient and scalable microservices using Kotlin, Java, and Rust,
      operating in Kubernetes environments with databases such as PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, and ScyllaDB,
      and leveraging technologies like Kafka, SQS, and SNS for asynchronous communication.

      I have contributed to projects applying Test-Driven Development (TDD), Cloud Native Applications,
      and DevOps best practices, implementing techniques for high availability and fault tolerance, such as HPA,
      Circuit Breaker, Rate Limit, Load Shedding, and Multi-Region fallback, in addition to performing load tests and
      Chaos Engineering to ensure solution robustness.

      I have hands-on experience with Agile methodologies, and have contributed to the creation of detailed technical
      documentation, such as RFCs and ADRs, to document strategic decisions and architectural processes.

    <h3>
      Software Engineer - Self-Employed
    </h3>
    <p>São Paulo, Brazil — Apr 2020 - Nov 2021</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I began my journey in technology in 2020, taking on roles as a Fullstack Software Engineer. During this time,
        I gained experience working with technologies such as PHP, the Laravel Framework, Node.js, Java, the Spring
        Framework, Vue.js, Electron, MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB. I contributed to the development of both the
        backend and frontend systems for a hotel reservation management app and an eCommerce platform for a bike shop.
        As I progressed, I shifted my focus towards creating high-performance APIs, leveraging my fullstack skills in
        both frontend and backend development. This evolution has strengthened my ability to lead projects that require
        a deep understanding of the entire technology stack, with an emphasis on delivering scalable and efficient
        solutions.

      <h3>Mobile App Development Program</h3>
      <p>Brazil — Mar 2017 - Dec 2017</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Participated in a project aimed at teaching and guiding high school students from public schools in Leopoldina-MG
          and the surrounding region in the development of mobile applications for the Android platform. Utilized MIT App
          Inventor to introduce students to app development, fostering technical skills and encouraging creative
          problem-solving. Contributed to the design and delivery of educational content, helping students gain

    <h2>EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATIONS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bachelor's degree in Control and Automation Engineer</strong> - CEFET Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica Leopoldina, Brazil - 2017 - 2022
        <ul>
          <li>
            For my engineering graduation thesis project, I developed a cross-platform Electrical and Electronics
            simulation software designed to be intuitive, multiplatform, and high-performance. The software aimed to
            support engineering problem-solving and enhance teaching strategies. Using the Electron framework, I
            implemented key methods such as Modified Nodal Analysis for circuit equation formulation and Linear
            Approximation for modeling nonlinear elements. The results from the software were validated against
            commercial simulators, providing an efficient and accessible tool for both educational and practical
            engineering applications.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bachelor's degree in Production Engineer</strong> - UNIS Cataguases, Brazil - 2014 - 2018
        <ul>
          <li>
            As part of my engineering graduation thesis project, I developed a virtual assistant (BOT) for a fast food
            franchise to optimize service time. Using neural networks and artificial intelligence, the BOT was designed
            to process customer requests efficiently. Built with C# and leveraging cloud computing, the BOT can interact
            via chat channels like Telegram, Slack, and Skype. The system reduced service time by 78.5%, achieving an
            average response time of 3.1 minutes. A customer satisfaction survey indicated positive approval of the
            project, demonstrating both its effectiveness and user acceptance.
